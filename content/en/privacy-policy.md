## 1. ABOUT THIS POLICY

At **Transopt™**, we take data protection seriously.

This Privacy Policy has been put together to provide our customers ("Customers") with transparent information and guidelines about the privacy and data protection aspects of our Transopt™ service.

This Privacy Policy has been divided into two sections:

### Customer as Data Controller

First of all, we wish to remind our Customers of their data protection responsibilities when collecting personal data via the Transopt™ service. These provisions can be found under the section "Customer as Data controller - What to keep in mind". Under this section, we have also gathered some general recommendations and best practices.

### Transopt™ as Data Controller

Secondly, this Privacy Policy is intended to serve as our own legal information document regarding the personal data we process about our Customers and users for our own purposes. These provisions can be found under the section "Transopt™ as Data Controller."

### Updates to this policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The current version can be found on our website: [Privacy Policy](https://Transopt.com/privacy-policy). We will not make substantial changes or reduce the rights of Customers under this Privacy Policy without providing a notice thereof.

## 3. CUSTOMER AS DATA CONTROLLER - WHAT TO KEEP IN MIND

### How does Transopt™ work?

The Transopt™ service is provided using our Route and Schedule Planning Software that enables customers to organize their mobile workforce - plan and optimize routes and schedules for their drivers, dispatch routes to drivers, monitor the situation in the field, and analyze driver performance. Our customers may use the data and analytics collected from the software for various purposes, including monitoring and optimizing the performance of their employees.

**Transopt™** does not actively monitor the type of data being collected. We also do not control the purposes for which the collected data is used.

### Key definitions: Data Subject, Data Controller, and Data Processor

In EU data protection legislation:

- The **Data Subject** is the individual whose personal data is subject to processing. For example, any identifiable drivers are Data Subjects.
- The **Data Controller** determines the purpose and measures of processing personal data, such as what information is collected and how it is used.
- The **Data Processor** handles data on behalf of the Data Controller.

For the data regarding drivers, the Customer is the Data Controller, whereas **Transopt™** acts as their Data Processor.

### Data processing agreement

The **EU General Data Protection Agreement (GDPR)** requires a data processing agreement between the Data Controller and Data Processor. These provisions have been incorporated into [Section 6 of our Terms of Service](https://Transopt.com/terms-of-service).

### Definition of personal data

Personal data is any piece of information from which an individual can be identified either directly or indirectly. Typical examples of personal data include names, addresses, phone numbers, and identifiable photographs. Exact location data can also be classified as personal data.

Please note that a combination of information may result in identifiable information, even if the pieces of information individually are not.

### Informing users

You are responsible for including your own privacy policy or other form of information document clarifying what personal data is collected and how it is handled. You may do this by adding a link to an external privacy policy of your organization or inserting your own privacy policy.

### Data Subject rights

The Data Subject has certain rights regarding their personal data, such as the right to access, correct, and in some cases, delete it. The Data Subject also has the right to withdraw any consent they have previously given. As a Data Controller, you are responsible for ensuring Data Subjects can exercise their legal rights. Your privacy policy should include clear contact details for Data Subjects to contact.

### Sensitive data and consents

Personal data revealing or concerning health, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, a person's sex life or sexual orientation, or race are considered to be categories of **sensitive personal data**. Collection, processing, and publication of this information generally require explicit consent from the individual.

### Publishing data results

To respect the privacy of Data Subjects, it is recommended to get their consent for publishing any data that may identify them. If consent has not been acquired, anonymization or pseudonymization is recommended.

### Natural persons as Data Controllers

Most of our Customers are companies, organizations, or public entities. However, sometimes natural persons may also independently use our service. Please note that Data Controller responsibilities apply regardless of the legal status of the Data Controller.

## 4. Transopt™ AS A DATA CONTROLLER

The following sections describe how **Transopt™** processes the personal data of its Customers and their representatives for its own purposes. This section does not apply to data collected by Customers. For that, please see the section "Customer as Data Controller."
